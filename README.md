Final Fantasy 1 Randomizer Tracker

Tracker has 8 variants including a brand new NOverworld tracker
- Standard or NOverworld modes without maps or shards.
- Shards for both modes
- Maps for both modes
- Shards + Maps for both modes

Autotracking available for use with EmoTracker + BizHawk through use of a lua script.
- Yes, this will work for NOverworld and will light up corresponding Mark or Sigil (in place of the Canoe and Floater respectively)

Some flags, locations, and items have multiple selections. Left click or right click to cycle forward or backwards. 

The "L" with a number next to it is an option for use to indicate Loose Items.
- An option for Duds will come in a future update. 
- Both these flag settings have no effect on the map or items, only for visual reference. 

Flags have been split between Map Edit flags and Incentive location flags.

New flag options were added. They are in order as they appear on the rando generation site under the "Mode and World" tab, section labeled "Overworld Edits"
- Early and Extendted open are a single button to cycle through for Vanilla, Open, and Extended Open.

Future updates planned:
- Incentives with gated progression. (ie rod-locked)
- Unsure if able to function with Autotracker just yet, work in progress. (ie lots of digging through code)
- An updated version of the NOverworld Map, hopefully with better map readability. 

If any of the logic is wonky, or something isnt functioning how you think it should, please reach out to me, @meklin89 in the FF1R Discord.

Enjoy!
